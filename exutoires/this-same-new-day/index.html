	  <p><em>it’s been quite a while.</em></p>

<p>Here I am, wibbley-wobbley, not lord of anything and most probably lost in time.
It got better the last few days. I opened the mailbox and sorted 3 month of
urgent bank requests. I called my landlord to tell him that I was still alive
and paying, and probably with a hole in my water tank. I stopped buying
things to make myself happy. I did laundry. I also went ahead and moved the
furniture ; this shelf is ugly and needs to go away. I cooked for the first
time in 9 months.</p>

<p>At the core of all this, I stopped believing my fantasies made me happy. Now I
tend to think exactly the contrary. Everytime I’m thinking, far away,
cloud-headed, is a missed happyness. No more of this.</p>

<p>Small steps further and I’m still nowhere closer to be an acceptable adult, but
now I think maybe I’ll get there.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll get there.</p>
